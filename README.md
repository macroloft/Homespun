# Homespun
Homespun is intended to help making HTML snippets and components reusable. It works a bit like the view part of components in well known SPA frameworks like React.js or Vue.js. It's actually in early development and primary a research and learning project. Homespun should help getting things done quickly and clean.

Homespun is mainly used in local dummy applications and is not tested for safety, so **I do not recommend to use it in productive applications** *(atm)*.
